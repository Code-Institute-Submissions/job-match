# TESTING

## Manual Testing

Testing was done throughout site development, for each feature before it was merged into the master file.

Usability was tested with the below user acceptance testing, sent to new users to ensure testing from different users, on different devices and browsers to ensure issues were caught and where possible fixed during development.

### Python Validation:

- No errors were found when the code was passed through Valentin Bryukhanov's [online validation tool](http://pep8online.com/). According to the reports, the code is [Pep 8-compliant](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). This checking was done manually by copying python code and pasting it into the validator.
