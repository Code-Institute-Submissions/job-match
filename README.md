## Agile Methodology

### GitHub Project Management

![GitHub Project Management](documentation/agile/github_project_management.png)

GitHub Project Management was used to manage the project. If it hadn't been for the GitHub project management, I wouldn't have been able to manage the development of the application. It helped me to prioritize the tasks and to keep track of my progress.
